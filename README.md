# Garage
Simulation of a Garage (24h programming)

Originally I planned to use a closed Access database, however not enough time.
I set myself a limit of 24 hours including breaks.

In Class Garage there is a main static method that should be used to start aplication.

There are a few things I haven't been able to fix because of lack os sleep.
